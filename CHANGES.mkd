# DaHelpers Changelog

## 0.0.3

### Fixed aliasing code

The tag aliasing was broken after 0.0.2 refactor. This is now fixed.

### Added `#props()` helper

The `#props()` helper is used for retrieving deeply nested object properties
without the need for checking whether individual segments of the property tree
are defined.

## 0.0.2

Minor improvements to documentation and small refactor of tag aliases code.
